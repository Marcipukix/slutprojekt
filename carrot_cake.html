    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All purpose Flour – If you use cake flour, use 2 1/4 cups.</li>
        <li>Salt – The salt is very important for really accentuating the flavors in your cake. You can use a little less or more if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon – You can add other spices as well such as a dash of ground nutmeg or cloves.</li>
        <li>Baking powder – You can’t replace your baking powder with only baking soda- it will create an unpleasant flavor in the cake.</li>
        <li>Baking soda – If you don’t have baking soda handy, you can use 2 1/4 tsp baking powder.</li>
        <li>Eggs – Use large eggs for this recipe.</li>
        <li>Oil – I used vegetable oil for this recipe. Canola oil, melted unsalted butter, or applesauce will also work.</li>
        <li>Sugar – I used white granulated sugar for this recipe, but you can sub some brown sugar in the batter if you want.</li>
        <li>Carrots – Always use fresh carrots! They’re the star of the show. Shred them using a cheese grater.</li>
        <li>Walnuts – I loaded this cake up with walnuts but you can use pecans or sweeter fillings like white chocolate chips or raisins.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a 9×13 inch baking pan well with cooking spray.</li>
          <li>Make the batter: In a large bowl mix the flour, salt, cinnamon, baking powder and baking soda. In another bowl add the sugar, eggs and vegetable oil. Mix until it all comes together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix everything until well combined.</li>
          <li>Add the carrots and walnuts: Using a spatula mix everything together until the carrots and walnuts are well incorporated into the batter.</li>
          <li>Bake: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan for 40-45 minutes.</li>
          <li>Feel free to add your favorite mix-in ingredients to this carrot cake! Pecans, sliced almonds, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, raisins; the options are endless and so delicious.</li>
